# Rave-DB
## Description:
A database systems project created in ASP.NET MVC. This is a music database that stores and plays songs after they have been uploaded.

## Before Use:
The album-arts folder must be created at the root, and the folder itself must contain arts numbered from 1 to n (with changes also made in the slider.js file) for the login/singup page to display random artworks for better looks.
